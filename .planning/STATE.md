## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- Remove Firestore entirely (no toggle) -- PostgreSQL is the only database
- Admin-only user creation (no self-registration)
- PyJWT + pwdlib[bcrypt] for auth (FastAPI official recommendations)
- openai SDK for LM Studio (OpenAI-compatible API)
- Alembic for migrations (not create_all)
- 24-hour JWT expiry, no refresh tokens (small internal team)
- Do NOT touch Dockerfile, docker-compose, or CI/CD

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [v1.6]: EnrichmentToolbar component still exported from barrel (unused, cleanup candidate)
- [v2.0]: Firestore implicit schemas -- audit during DB phases for fields not in SQLAlchemy models
